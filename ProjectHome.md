# Just add SCORM #

LibSCORM is a JavaScript library for creating SCORM 2004 courses in **Flash** or **HTML**. It is developed and maintained by the <a href='http://www.academiccolab.org'>Academic ADL Co-Laboratory</a>.

It's a great place to start because it provides
  * diligent error checking
  * cross-browser compatibility
  * consistent behavior across learning management systems

# Keep it simple #

LibSCORM is modular, and keeps simple tasks _simple_. At its core it includes a few JavaScript files which elegantly abstract
  * the connection with the learning management system
  * CMI "bags" like interactions and objectives
  * sequencing requests
  * error handling/reporting

# More with less #

If you opt for more features, the library will
  * provide a navigation interface for flipping through multiple pages within the SCO
  * load Flash SWFs and connect them with SCORM
  * Post diagnostic messages to a popup debug console

# Easy template #

Finally, LibSCORM offers a template to insulate course designers from these details. To make a full-featured SCO, developers can simply put their content pages into a directory and edit a fill-in-the-blank configuration file.
